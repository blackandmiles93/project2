# A Vitriolic Cherry Pitt

I will be creating a wiki page called A Vitriolic Cherry Pitt. It will be a general purpose wiki page that will have a database with a seed.js file to seed the SQLite database. Users will be able to freely edit, delete and add article content (eventually I would like to make it so that only an admin can delete items and users must have an account to edit content).
